        <p>I love Memes, Skiing, and Football. </p>

        <h3>Expectations:</h3>
        <p>
            I have seen that a lot of companies use ASP .NET and look for that skill in each applicant's resume
            I hope that I will gain enough knowledge about developing with these languages and frameworks to be able to
            make myself a competitive applicant. I'd also love to learn about design patterns. I think it's very important for us to get
            experience with C# because it is a language that is different from the others we have learned so far.
        </p>
